#  Build LLM ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ


A hands-on repository where I tinker, train, and transform language models from the ground up. Imagine it as a playground for neural networks, where code meets creativity! 🧩🤖✨

##  What You’ll Explore (*/ω＼*)

```text
⌨️ Tokenization Experiments
   Turn text → numbers → magic. Watch your words get "vectorized"!

🔄 Transformers From Scratch
   - Self-Attention (because every token deserves to be heard)
   - Multi-Head Attention (like gossiping, but mathematically)
   - Feed-Forward Layers (aka the brain's gym)
   - Layer Normalization (keeping neurons calm under pressure)

📝 Mini GPT Models
   Tiny models with big dreams—they try their best to talk back.

💃 Gradient Gymnastics
   Watch gradients twist, turn, and pirouette during training.

🕵️‍♂️ Parameter & Memory Detective Work
   Peek under the hood: because yes, model size *does* matter.

## Getting Started ╰(*°▽°*)╯

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Build-LLM-Playground.git
cd Build-LLM-Playground
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install torch tiktoken transformers
```

### 3️⃣ Run Experiments

```bash
python ch3_gpt_model/main.py
```

## Notes (❁´◡`❁)

```text
⚠️ These models are tiny.
   They won’t take over the world… yet! 😎

🔍 Some experiments compare against Hugging Face models.
   Goal: learn-by-building, not just copying.

💡 Expect bugs, unexpected outputs, and occasional "why is this happening?!" moments.
   That’s all part of the fun!

😎 Contributions, ideas, memes → always welcome.
